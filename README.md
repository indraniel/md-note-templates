CSS and JavaScript templates to use for rendering my markdown-based notes

The `js/highlight.pack.js` and `css/github-highlight.css` code was custom
rendered from [highlightjs.org][1].

The `css/github-markdown.css` stylesheet was based upon
[sindreshorhus/github-markdown-css][2].

The static CSS and JS files are being served via [MaxCDN][3].  See [rawgit][4]
for details on setting this up.
